#### Improved i.MX93 Support
- **Enhanced secure boot detection** for i.MX93 EdgeLock Enclave (ELE) systems
- **Fixed kernel signature verification** to properly detect hardware-based secure boot
- **Improved boot chain verification** to recognize ELE, U-Boot FIT signatures, and factory signing

#### Test Coverage Expansion
- **Container Security Tests (7 tests)**: Docker/Podman security, image scanning, runtime isolation
- **Certificate Management Tests (10 tests)**: X.509 validation, PKI infrastructure, certificate lifecycle
- **Production Hardening Tests (10 tests)**: Debug interface lockdown, credential management, system hardening
- **Enhanced existing test suites** with more comprehensive checks

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

#### Test Framework Redesign
- **Resolved async trait compatibility issues** with enum-based test registry design
- **Improved test execution flow** with better error handling and status reporting
